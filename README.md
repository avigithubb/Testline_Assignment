# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

This is the frontend of the project built on react where I handled the API data to create a interactive and gamified quiz interface.

It has three parts

- A *Start* or *Landing* page.
- A *Home* page for actual quiz.
- A *Result* page to display the score with explanation.
